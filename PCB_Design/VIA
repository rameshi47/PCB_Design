VIA - Vertical interconnect Access Filled with Epoxy (dielectric).
Used for routing from layer to layer.
Types of via [mivro, blind, through-hole, buried].
Methods of via [stitching, fencing].
Using drill-back to remove the unwanted copper plate or (minimize stub length)to reduce reflections.
Signal => prioritize minimum stub length to avoid reflection.
Power and Ground => need to handle high current so consider size and quantity.

****** single 0.3 mm VIA handles ~0.5 A with good thermal relief. **********

****** for high current, use multiple vias in parallel ******

****** Annular Ring = (Pad diameter - Drill Diameter) / 2 *******
