SCHEMATIC [OrCAD CAPTURE]
=========

[MAY 15 - 20]

1) Capture & Development
2) DataSheet
3) Library
4) Multipart lib or Split Sheet
5) FootPrints
5) Connections [Netalias, OFF Page, Hierarchical]
6) BOM
7) Netlist

NOTES{" Save all the files in one project, start with library creation, take footprint or design from datasheet and alternate, create a .dsn and place the components, make connections,
        create a BOM, create a netlist" }
